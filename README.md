# SAS Traffic Data Modeling Project

This project demonstrates advanced data analysis and modeling techniques using SAS on traffic datasets.

## 📌 Project Objective
- Analyze traffic data to identify key factors affecting traffic outcomes  
- Build regression models incorporating both continuous and categorical (0/1) variables  
- Perform time series analysis to capture trends over time  
- Evaluate statistical significance using parameter estimates, errors, and p-values  
- Interpret correlation and model outputs to determine meaningful relationships  

## 🔹 Methods and Skills
- Data cleaning and preprocessing in SAS  
- Regression modeling (linear/logistic depending on outcome)  
- Handling categorical variables and dummy coding  
- Time series analysis to observe trends and seasonality  
- Statistical evaluation: parameter estimates, standard errors, p-values, correlations  
- Drawing insights from model outputs to determine variable impact  

## 🔹 Outcome / Insights
- Identified variables that significantly influence traffic outcomes  
- Determined correlations between key features  
- Model outputs provide actionable insights into traffic behavior patterns  
- Statistical significance guides interpretation of which factors meaningfully affect the target  

## 🗂 Files
- `SAS Traffic Modeling.sas`  
- `screenshots/` (output tables, regression results, parameter estimates)
